i)
The variable fname_out gives a string path name for storing each .png figure. The file name is built up of three bits; the Home variable which is likely an absolute path to the 
output directory, the Metadata variable which has the prefix “Ozone_” followed by some date and time information and “.png” file extension. 
The date in the code snippet is hard coded but the comment indicates this could be read from the corresponding input file.  

ii)
Two variables are undefined. The “Home” variable likely indicates the path of the output directory. 
This could be specified as an argument when running the python script or could default to the current directory via the os.getcwd() function. 
The other undefined variable is “simhour” in the “Frame” variable which likely gives the associated time of the run. The rest of the “Frame” variable specifies that “simhour” will 
be converted to a string with 4 significant digits padded by zeros.
